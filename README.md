# Generative AI Multi-Agent System on Databricks

This project demonstrates how to build, deploy, and evaluate a generative AI multi-agent system using the Databricks. It showcases the integration of tools like LangChain, Mosaic AI, MLflow, and external LLMs to deliver intelligent, autonomous agents.

 ## 🚀 Use Case :  Catalonia Multi-agent Startup assistant
Help new entrepreneurs navigate the complex process of starting a business by guiding them through official procedures and documents from trusted sources. This is achieved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combined with a multi-agent architecture.

Built with **Databricks Mosaic AI, LangChain, MLflow, and LLMs (Llama and Claude)**

## 🔁 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
1. Ingest & Preprocess: Load datasets into Unity Catalog and preprocess.
2. Indexing: Build vector search indices.
3. Model Design: Develop a LangGraph-based multi-agent architecture.
4. Deploy & Test: Serve agents with Mosaic AI, test via AI Playground or APIs.
5. Evaluate & Iterate:  Use MLflow for experiment tracking and agent evaluation.
7. Productionize: Implement monitoring, safety guardrails, and governance policies.
